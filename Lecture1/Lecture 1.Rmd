# The goals of this class 

<br>
<div id="left">
1. Understand important financial institutions and markets 
2. Provide a toolkit for creating portfolios of financial assets
3. Use **asset pricing models** to understand the trade-off between risk and return
4. Apply these models to:
    1. identify investment opportunities 
    2. evaluate portfolio performance

# Timeline for our course
## Part 1: Institutional details
<div id="left">
* Who are the buyers and issuers of financial instruments?
* Define assets + securities classes

<div id="left2">

* How do we interpret observed returns?
    + Build to a model of returns
* Three ingredients necessary for our models:
    1. Defining risk appetite/aversion
    2. Understanding mean‐variance trade-off 
    3. Allocating between risky and safe investments 
* Use models to construct a portfolio of risky investments

# Timeline for our course
## Part 3: Critical evaluation of the tools

<div id="left2">
* How consistent is CAPM with the data?
* How consistent is the data with APT? 
    + Markets are efficient? Or is it behavioral?
* How should we use the models when there are market anomalies?
    + Active portfolio management
    + Treynor-Black / Black-Litterman

## Mutual Funds Fees

* Fee Structure: Four types
    1. Operating expenses (recurring)
    2. 12 b‐1 charge (recurring)
    3. Front‐end load (one time)
    4. Back‐end load (one time)
* Fees must be disclosed in the prospectus
* Share classes with different fee combinations

## Mutual Funds - costs over time

Mutual fund expense ratios have fallen over time, driven by several factors

1. Scale economies - assets under management have grown
2. Competition - investors pick funds with lower expense ratios
3. Increased presence of employer-sponsored retirement plans

# Institutions
## Closed-End Funds

* Unlike mutual funds (open-end), no change in shares outstanding
* Old investors cash out by selling to new investors
* Managers unburdened with managing flows
* Traded continuously on exchanges
* Priced at premium or discount to NAV 
    - No easy arbitrage to close price gaps
* Hedge funds may ride discounts
    - Alternatively, may attempt to “open” funds

# Market Structure
## Types of Markets: Specialist Exchanges
<div class="column-left2">

* Example of a specialist exchange: NYSE
* Trading traditionally occurred through a combination of an auction (the order book) and a market maker (the specialist)
* Orders sent to exchange may be cleared electronically or sent to specialist
    - Only one specialist for each stock
    - Specialist may act as broker or as a dealer

</div>
  
---

# Market Structure
## Roles of specialists in specialist exchanges

* Broker
  - Matches buy and sell orders
  - Income generated by commissions

* Dealer
  - Specialists maintain their own bid and ask quotes and fill orders with own account if market spread too high
  - Historically, participated in about 25% of all transactions
  - Maintained price continuity


---

# Market Structure
##  Types of Markets: OTC Markets

* Trades negotiated dealer‐to‐dealer
* Nasdaq (National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotation system)
  - Originally, a price quotation system
  - Large orders may still be negotiated through brokers and dealers
  - Today, NASDAQ provides electronic trading (less OTC)

# Market Structure
##  Types of Markets: Electronic Communication Networks

<div class="column-left2">
* Private computer networks that directly link buyers with sellers for automated order execution
* To attract liquidity, networks may pay rebates to liquidity providers (market makers)
* Electronic clearing facilitates high frequency trading

# Market Structure
## Electronic Communication Networks and flash crashes

<div class="column-left2">
SEC findings suggest the decline was triggered by a large automated sell order for S&P futures by a mutual fund

- Existing low volume due to high market uncertainty
- Sell order (75K contracts) was an automated algorithm that directed to sell 9% of prior minute’s trading volume
- HFTs responded to high volume of trades, but could not find fundamental buyers (SEC describes a game of “hot‐ potato”)
- High volume led to acceleration in sell order speed, which drove higher volatility and volume

# Market Structure
## Short-selling

* In our optimal portfolio, we’ll have the option to "short"–sell stocks that we don’t own
* Why would we?
    1. Stock may be overpriced (negative alpha)
    2. Stock may be appropriately priced, but we want to hedge out risk from a long position in a similar security (pairs trading)
* So what is it?

# Market Structure
## Short-selling Mechanics

Suppose we have one dollar and believe stock A will underperform stock B.

* Buy $1 of asset B
* Borrow \$1 worth of stock A ( $1 \big/ P_A$ shares) and promptly sell the stock
    - Now, you owe the owner of A his shares back and will have to repurchase them in the market at tomorrow’s price
    - Proceeds from the sale serve as collateral to stock lender (e.g. \$1)
    - Reg T requires 50% additional collateral (above and beyond proceeds) be kept in account (shares of B will suffice)

$$\text{Final Payoff} = 1 + (r_B ‐ r_A) + \ldots+ \underbrace{\text{short rebate}}_{\text{to be defined}}$$

# Market Structure
## Short-selling Mechanics

<font size="5">

* Assume that $P_{A} = 100$, and you want to short the stock. What will your return be if the stock drops to $P_{A} = 25$?

* First, calculate your initial position:
    1. You will borrow a share of stock A and sell it immediately. You now have $100 dollars, but owe 1 share of Stock A.
    2. You addditionally post the required 50\% collateral (e.g. \$50 of a treasury bill)
    
| Assets                   | Liabilities       | 
|:-------------------------|:------------------|
| Cash 100                 | Short position 100|
| T-Bill Collateral     50 | Equity         50 |

* Now imagine the stock drops to $P_{A}$ = 25 and you close your position:
    1. You buy the stock at \$25, and return it to the original owner
    2. The collateral and cash are returned to you, net of your purchase

* As a result, you have 75 dollars profit. Your return is $r_{\text{short}} = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75$
* Note that the maximum upside is a return of 100\%. Why? Because the initial sale at 100\$ creates a liability of \$100 dollars -- at best, this liability goes to zero, netting 100 dollars in profit and a return of 100\%. 
    - Note that the **downside** is unlimited.

# Market Structure
## Short-selling Mechanics

<font size="5">

* Now assume we do this in pairs. There are two stocks, $A$ and $B$, each worth 100 dollars.We buy stock $B$ and short stock $A$. What will your return be if next period, $P_{A} = 90$ and $P_{B} = 105$?

* First, calculate your initial position:
    1. You will borrow a share of stock A and sell it immediately. You now have $100 dollars, but owe 1 share of Stock A.
    2. You addditionally post the required 50\% collateral (you can post stock $B$ shares)
    
| Assets                   | Liabilities       | 
|:-------------------------|:------------------|
| Cash 100                 | Short position 100|
| Stock B Collateral     50| Equity         100|
| Stock B       50         | |

* Now imagine the stocks change to $P_{A} = 90$ and $P_{B} = 105$ and you close your position:
    1. You buy the stock at \$90, and return it to the original owner
    2. The collateral and cash are returned to you, net of your purchase
    3. You sell Stock B at $105

* As a result, you have 10 dollars profit from stock A and 5 dollars profit from stock B.
    - Your returns are $r_{\text{short}} = -r_{A} = 0.1$ and $r_{\text{long}} = r_{B}$ = 0.05
    - Our total profit is 15 dollars. Our net return is ((100 - 90) + (105 - 100))/100 =0.15.

# Market Structure
## What is the short rebate?

* Short rebate is the interest I earn on my dollar of collateral sitting with the stock lender

$$ \text{Short Rebate} = r_{f} - \text{Security lending Fee} $$

* Securities lending fees vary greatly and reflect how easy the shares are to borrow (often less than 20 bps)
* In obvious shorting situations, short rebate will go negative (shares “hot or trading “special”) or can’t be found

## Alternative ways to short stocks: *synthetic* shorts

Consider the following replicating strategy: 

* Buy a put and sell a call at the current strike price
    * Have the option to sell stock at current price 
    * Give someone else the option to buy the stock at today's price 
* What happens if real stock goes down 10x? up 10x? 
* However, options traded on less than half of publicly traded firms
* Moreover, options market behaves badly for “hot shares”
    - Put-call parity is violated by large amounts of short interest
        -Call prices should be greater than put prices!
        -More generally:  the call price minus the put price is greater than the stock price minus the exercise price.
    – E.g. 3com and Palm
