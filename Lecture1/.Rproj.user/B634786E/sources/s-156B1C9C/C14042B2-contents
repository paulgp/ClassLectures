## Lecture 2: Risk and Return
</section>

---

## Assets

* Let’s begin by focusing on two major asset classes - stocks and bonds
* How have these assets performed historically? 
    - Mean and variance (as well as some alternative measures)
* First...some housekeeping regarding return calculations

---

## Return Definitions

* "Return" = rate of return = net return
$$
r_{t} = \frac{P_{t} + D_{t}}{P_{t-1}} - 1
$$
    - Gross returns (sometimes $R_{t}$) refer to $1+r_{t}$
    - The risk free rate will be called $r_{f}$
    - Excess returns above the risk free rate are $r_{e} = r - r_{f}$

---

## Return Defintions

* A holding period return of $T$ years is 
$$
  r_{0,T} = (1+r_{1})(1+r_{1})\ldots (1+r_{T}) - 1
$$
* The equivalent annualized return is 
$$
(1+r_{0,T})^{\frac{1}{T}} - 1
$$

---

## Return Definitions
## Average Returns

* Arithmetic average returns
$$
\overline{r} = \frac{1}{T}(r_{1} + r_{2} + \ldots + r_{T})
$$
* Geometric average returns
$$
r_{G} = \left[(1+r_{1})(1+r_{1})\ldots (1+r_{T})\right]^{\frac{1}{T}} - 1 = \big[\frac{P_{T}}{P_{0}}\big]^{\frac{1}{T}} - 1
$$
    - Arithmetic average is unbiased estimate of 1-period future returns (expected returns)
    - Geometric average is a measure of cumulative past performance

---

## Return Defintions
## Return Variance

* We calculate estimates of variance using squared deviations from arithmetic average returns
$$
\sigma^{2}(r) = VAR(r) = \frac{1}{T}((r_{1}-\overline{r})^{2} + (r_{2}-\overline{r})^{2} + \ldots + (r_{T}-\overline{r})^{2}))
$$
* Standard deviation is the square-root of variance:
$$
\sigma(r) = SD(r) = \sqrt{\frac{1}{T}((r_{1}-\overline{r})^{2} + (r_{2}-\overline{r})^{2} + \ldots + (r_{T}-\overline{r})^{2}))}
$$

---

## Return Defintions
## Return Covariance

* Finally, covariance measures how two returns move together
$$
\sigma_{i,j} = COV(r_{i}, r_{j}) = \frac{1}{T}((r_{1,i}-\overline{r}_{i})(r_{1,j}-\overline{r}_{j}) + (r_{2,i}-\overline{r}_{i})(r_{2,j}-\overline{r}_{j}) + \ldots + (r_{T,i}-\overline{r}_{i})(r_{T,j}-\overline{r}_{j}))
$$
* Correlations scale the covariance by standard deviations
$$
\rho_{i,j} = \frac{\sigma_{i,j}}{\sigma_{i}\sigma_{j}}
$$
* Excel provides functions AVERAGE,GEOMEAN,VAR, STDEV, and COVAR

## Wanted: Information about risk and return

* To make investment decisions, we need to know
    - ... the expected returns
    - ... the riskiness of returns
* We turn to historical return data for these 
    - A caveat...
    - The data give a pretty good sense of the risk, but expected returns are harder to measure.

## Asset Returns: Historical Record
## United States

* Siegel (1992) provides mean real return data for the U.S. since 1802 (standard deviation in parenthesis):

FIGURE FROM SIEGEL 1992


* Historic variation in risk premium (stocks minus bonds) 

* Stock returns are remarkably strong. Is US an outlier?

---

## Asset Returns: Historical Record
## Average Cross Country Equity Returns 

PICTURE

* Average return across 16 developed countries is 5.1%
* US returns high, but not an outlier

---

## Asset Returns: Historical Record
## Standard Deviation of Cross Country Equity Returns

PICTURE

* Average s.d. of returns is 23% (US 20%)
* Italy, German, Japan suggest low probability disasters can have a large effect on returns.

---

## Asset Returns: Historical Record
## High returns or survivorship bias?

PICTURE

Countries with low returns fall out of the analysis (Jorion and Goetzmann (1999)). Median real return of all other countries is 0.75% (compared to 4.3% for US).

---

## Still waiting for data?

Most recent U.S. historical data suggest:

* Average excess returns of large stocks over long term bonds ($r_{e}$) of roughly 6% ... with a standard deviation of 20% ($\sigma_{e}$)
* With 80+ years of data, **standard error** associated with mean excess returns is
$$
\sigma(\overline{r}_{e}) = \frac{\sigma(r_{e})}{\sqrt{T}} \approx \frac{20 \%}{9} \approx 2.2\%
$$
* Can we reject the null hypothesis that excess returns are 4%... or 2%?

---

## Going forward?

PICTURE

---

## The Gordon Model 

PICTURE

* Estiamte is about 6-7% nominal expected return for stocks, or 4% real, or a risk premium of 2-3% over nominal bonds
* This is very low versus history
* To believe anything else, you must disagree with PAYOUT, E/P, or G.

## Takeaways

* We still have a limited amount of high quality data to make inferences from, but...
* Historical data suggests a premium for risk in asset returns, but the size of the premium is up for debate
* If expected returns for the **aggregate stock market** with 80+ years of data are so imprecise, what are we to do with individual stocks?
* Need more than data to understand expected returns

---

## Postscript: other risk measures

Value at Risk (VaR)

* A measure of loss most frequently associated with extreme negative returns
* VaR is the quantile of a distribution below which lies q % of the possible values of that distribution
* The 5% VaR, commonly estimated in practice, tells us how bad returns (or losses) will be in the worst 5% of times


---

## VaR under normality

* 5% VaR return is equal to E(r) - 1.645 X s.d.
    - 5% Value at Risk (VaR) represents the lower bound on the return’s 10% confidence interval
* Under non-normality, look at historic returns for 5% cutoff

---

## Expected Shortfall (ES)

* Also called conditional tail expectation (CTE)
* More conservative measure of downside risk than VaR
    - VaR takes the highest return from the worst cases
    - ES takes an average return of the worst cases
