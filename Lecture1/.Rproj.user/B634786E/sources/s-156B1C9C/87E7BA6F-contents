## Introduction

* The goals of this class:
    + Understand the institutions and markets that matter
    + Provide a toolkit for selecting portfolios of financial assets
    + A framework: "asset pricing models" to understand the trade-off between risk and return
    + Models provides means to identify opportunities and evaluate portfolio performance

---

## First Chunk of class

* Instutional details
    + Who issues, and who buys?
    + Define assets + securities classes
    + How are financial assets traded?
    + How have these done over the years?
        - Strong focus on statistical properties and *data*
        
testing

---

## Second Chunk of class

* How do we interpret the returns we observe?
    + We need a model...and we’ll get there.
* First, some basic portfolio management tools 
    + Risk appetite/aversion
    + Mean‐variance analysis
    + Allocating between risky and safe investments 
    + Constructing a portfolio of risky investments
        - **C**aptial **A**sset **P**ricing **M**odel
        - **A**rbitrage **P**ricing **T**heory / Factor Models
        
---

## Evaluate the Models
* How consistent is CAPM with the data?
* How consistent is the data with APT? 
    + Markets are efficient? Or is it behavioral?
* How should we use the models when there are market anomalies?
    + Active portfolio management
    + Treynor-Black / Black-Litterman
    + Robust Portfolio Management
    
---

## Evaluate the Returns
* The CAPM/APT also describes returns from a passive strategy (no skill required)
    + How to evaluate “active managers”?
        - Portfolio evaluation techniques answer the question “did you beat your benchmark?”
        - Performance attribution answers the question, “how did you beat your benchmark?”

## Mutual Funds

* Also called open end funds
    + Investors pool and benefits from sharing information <br> collection and back‐office costs
* Fund issues new shares when investors buy in and redeems shares when investors cash out
* Priced at Net Asset Value (NAV):

$$ \frac{\text{Market Value of Assets} - \text{Liabilities}}{\text{Shares Outstanding}} $$

## Do funds managers earn their fees?

* Performance of actively managed funds below the return on the Wilshire index in 23 of the 39 years from 1971 to 2009
