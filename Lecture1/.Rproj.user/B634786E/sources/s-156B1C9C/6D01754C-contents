## Lecture 1: Course Overview and Review of Institutions and Markets
</section>

---

# The goals of this class 

<br>
<div id="left">
1. Understand the institutions and markets that matter
2. Provide a toolkit for creating portfolios of financial assets
3. Use **asset pricing models** to understand the trade-off between risk and return
4. Apply these models to:
    1. identify investment opportunities 
    2. evaluate portfolio performance

</div> 

---

# Timeline for our course
## Part 1: Institutional details
<div id="left">
* Who issues, and who buys?
* Define assets + securities classes
* How are financial assets traded?
* How have these financial assets performed historically?
    - Strong focus on statistical properties and *data*
    
</div> 

---

# Timeline for our course
## Part 2: Portfolio tools

* How do we interpret observed returns?
    + We need a model... 
* But first, some basic portfolio management tools 
    + Defining risk appetite/aversion
    + Understanding mean‐variance trade-off 
    + Allocating between risky and safe investments 
    + Constructing a portfolio of risky investments
        - **C**aptial **A**sset **P**ricing **M**odel
        - **A**rbitrage **P**ricing **T**heory / Factor Models
        
---

# Timeline for our course
## Part 3: Critical evaluation of the tools

* How consistent is CAPM with the data?
* How consistent is the data with APT? 
    + Markets are efficient? Or is it behavioral?
* How should we use the models when there are market anomalies?
    + Active portfolio management
    + Treynor-Black / Black-Litterman
    + Robust Portfolio Management
    
---

# Timeline for our course
## Part 4: Evaluate and attribute portfolio returns

* CAPM / APT describe returns from a *passive* strategy (no skill required)
* How should we evaluate active managers?
    - Portfolio evaluation techniques answer the question “did you beat your benchmark?”
    - Performance attribution answers the question, “how did you beat your benchmark?”

---

# Timeline for our course
## Part 5: Applications and alternative forms of investing

* Private equity and hedge funds
* International investing
* Fixed income (bonds, futures, forwards)

## Mutual Funds - Basic Definitions


* Also called open end funds
    + Investors pool and benefits from sharing information <br> collection and back‐office costs
* Fund issues new shares when investors buy in and redeems shares when investors cash out
* Priced at Net Asset Value (NAV):

$$ \frac{\text{Market Value of Assets} - \text{Liabilities}}{\text{Shares Outstanding}} $$


---

## Mutual Funds - Costs of Investing in Mutual Funds

* Fee Structure: Four types
    1. Operating expenses (recurring)
    2. 12 b‐1 charge (recurring)
    3. Front‐end load (one time)
    4. Back‐end load (one time)
* Fees must be disclosed in the prospectus
* Share classes with different fee combinations

---

## Mutual Funds - Example of Fees for Various Classes




---

## Mutual Funds - Fees and Incentives 

* People don't (can't?) avoid high-fee index funds (Choi et al. 2010)

* Experimenters overfocused on returns since *fund inception*

![](choi_et_al_mutualfunds.png)


---

## Mutual Funds - Fees and Incentives 

* Fund flow response distorts risk-taking incentives (Chevalier and Ellison (1997))

![](chevalier_ellison_fund_flows.png)

---

## Mutual Funds - Costs over time

* Mutual fund expense ratios have fallen over time
* Driven by several factors:
    1. Scale economies - assets under management have grown
    2. Competition - investors pick funds with lower expense ratios
    3. Increased presence of employer-sponsored retirement plans
    
```{r, include=FALSE}
mf_expenses <- read_csv("mutual_fund_expenses.csv")
library(viridis)
```

```{r, echo=FALSE,   out.width='1600px' , fig.asp = .4}
ggplot(data=mf_expenses %>% mutate(expenses = `expense ratios` * 100)) + 
  geom_col(aes(x=Year, y= expenses), fill = "#0f4d92") +

## Mutual Funds - Do fund managers earn their fees?

* Are all mutual fund managers like Andy Dwyer, or just the average?
* Malkiel (1995) evaluates 239 mutual funds with at least ten-year records
    + Compare each fund's performance to holding the S&P 500

## Mutual Funds -- Persistence in performance?

* Evidence for persistent superior performance is weak, but suggestive.
* Malkiel (1995) tracks funds based on above/below median performance

--- 

## Mutual Funds -- Persistence in performance?

* Bollen and Busse (2004) find tiny persistence at the quarterly level


--- 

## Mutual Funds -- Persistence in performance?

Fama French “Luck vs Skill in Mutual Fund Returns” 2010

* Value weighted portfolio of active funds earns the market return, minus fees
* Distribution of “alpha” looks more consistent with luck than skill


---

## Closed End Funds

* No change in shares outstanding
* Old investors cash out by selling to new investors
* Managers unburdened with managing flows
* Traded continuously on exchanges
* Priced at premium or discount to NAV * No easy arbitrage to close price gaps
* Hedge funds may ride discounts
* Alternatively, may attempt to “open” funds

---

## Other buyers/Other perspectives

* Pension funds
* Endowment Funds
* Alternative Asset Managers
* ...to be discussed in the context of cases and guest lectures
* Next up...market structure

---

## What kinds of markets are there?

1. Specialist Markets
2. Over-the-counter (OTC) markets
3. Electronic Communication Markets

---

## What types of orders are there?

* Market order
    – Buy or sell order to be executed immediately at prevailing bid/ask price
* Limit order
    – Buy or sell order with a pre‐specified limit for the price

---

## Limit orders make up a limit order book

Examples of Limit order books from Justin

---

## Types of Markets: Specialist Exchanges

* Traditionally, on specialist-based exchanges, trading occurred through a combination of an auction (the order book) and a market maker (the specialist)
* Orders sent to exchange may be cleared electronically or sent to specialist
  – Only one specialist for each stock
  – Specialist may act as broker or as a dealer
  
---

##  Types of Markets: Specialist Exchanges
## Roles of Specialists

* Broker
  – Matches buy and sell orders
  – Income generated by commissions

* Dealer
  – Specialists maintain their own bid and ask quotes and fill orders with own account if market spread too high
  – Historically, participated in about 25% of all transactions
  – Maintained price continuity


---

##  Types of Markets: OTC Markets

* Trades negotiated dealer‐to‐dealer
* Nasdaq (National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotation system)
  – Originally, a price quotation system
  – Large orders may still be negotiated through brokers and dealers
  – Today, NASDAQ provides electronic trading (less OTC)
  
  

---

##  Types of Markets: Electronic Communication Networks

* ECNs:Private computer networks that directly link buyers with sellers for automated order execution
* To attract liquidity, networks may pay rebates to liquidity providers (market makers)
* Electronic clearing facilitates high frequency trading
  
    

---

##  Types of Markets: Electronic Communication Networks
## High Frequency Trading

* Risks of high speed algorithmic trading include market disruption
* Flash Crash (2010)
  – On May 6, 2010, US indices fell by more than 5% in a matter of minutes, before rebounding almost as quickly
* Knight Capital (2012)
  – Flawed deployment of new trading program bankrupts major market maker
  
  
---

##  Types of Markets: Electronic Communication Networks
## Flash Crash

* SEC findings suggest the decline was triggered by a large automated sell order for S&P futures by a mutual fund
    - Existing low volume due to high market uncertainty
    – Sell order (75K contracts) was an automated algorithm that directed to sell 9% of prior minute’s trading volume
    – HFTs responded to high volume of trades, but could not find fundamental buyers (SEC describes a game of “hot‐ potato”)
    – High volume led to acceleration in sell order speed, which drove higher volatility and volume
  
  
---

## Short-selling
* In our optimal portfolio, we’ll have the option to "short"– sell stocks that we don’t own
* Why would we?
  – Stock may be overpriced (negative alpha)
  – Stock may be appropriately priced, but we want to hedge out risk from a long position in a similar security (pairs trading)

    
---

## Short-selling
## Mechanics

Suppose we have one dollar and believe stock A will underperform stock B.

* Buy $1 of B
* Borrow \$1 worth of A (1/ $P_A$ shares) and promptly sell
  - Now you owe the owner of A his shares back‐ you will have to repurchase them in the market at tomorrow’s price
  - Proceeds from the sale serve as collateral to stock lender
  - Reg T requires 50% additional collateral (above and beyond proceeds) be kept in account (shares of B will suffice) 
* Final Payoff $=(1+r_B ‐ r_A)...+$ short rebate

---

PICTURE


---

## Short-selling
## What is the short rebate?


* Short rebate is the interest I earn on my dollar of collateral sitting with the stock lender
    – Short Rebate$=$rf$‐$Security lending Fee
* Securities lending fees vary greatly and reflect how easy the shares are to borrow (often less than 20 bps)
* In obvious shorting situations, short rebate will go negative (shares “hot or trading “special”) or can’t be found

---

## Short-selling
## Alternative ways to short stocks: *synthetic* shorts

Consider the following replicating strategy: Buy a put and sell a call at the current strike price

* However, options traded on less than half of publicly traded firms
* Moreover, options market behaves badly for “hot shares”
    – E.g. 3com and Palm
